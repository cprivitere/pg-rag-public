"""Parity guard: shared code must stay byte-identical across the two-repo split.

`pg-rag-public` and `pg-rag-private` deliberately share one source of truth for
pipeline code: the private checkout is a strict superset (identical shared
files + IL2CPP decomp source). This script enforces that invariant by diffing
every shared file (tracked in BOTH repos), with line endings normalized, and
failing on any *unsanctioned* difference.

Sanctioned differences live in SANCTIONED below with the reason they differ —
add a file there when a divergence is a deliberate design decision, never as
a convenience merge.
