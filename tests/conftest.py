"""Session-scoped source immutability guard.

``data/cdn`` and ``data/wiki`` are a read-only download cache; only the
download/verify scripts may write them. Every other pipeline stage reads and
derives from them. This guard snapshots the source tree at session start and
asserts it is unchanged at teardown, so any test that mutates real source data
fails loudly instead of silently corrupting the cache.

Snapshot scope is deliberately narrow: for ``data/wiki`` only the page ``*.txt``
and ``.meta.json`` are source. Derived artifacts (``.parsed.json``, ``curated/``)
are governed by the code moves that keep them out of the source dir, not by this
guard.
