"""Lint gate: `ruff check src scripts tests` must be clean.

Contract: any finding in the linted trees fails the offline test suite, so a
regression introduced by an edit is caught by `mise test` / `uv run pytest`.
Config lives in `ruff.toml` (repo root) — reads it for the skip tier:
excluded modules stay unguarded. Formatting is NOT gated here (the formatter
is a tool, not a test assertion); only `check` findings fail.

Module-level because the lint scan is process-wide: one subprocess per pytest
session, not per test.
