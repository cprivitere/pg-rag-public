# Max context chars fed to the LLM (output is separate). 80000 is the
# golden-validated config: the then-current production winner (gemma-4-12B-it-qat) measured a
# 7-facts-missing baseline at this value. A tighter worst-density-safe 54k
# cap did NOT help golden (8 missing — wide general/lookup contexts lost
# facts; a later 80k run scored 10, all within run-to-run LLM variance), so
# the golden-validated value wins and extraction is NOT traded for a
# theoretical worst-density guarantee. rag/pipeline.py (`_fit_context`) hard-
# caps prompt context to this budget, so retrieval + sibling expansion can
# never silently push past it (the reachable overflow). Residual caveat:
# ~80k chars of the densest content (~2.4 chars/token, measured worst in
# chunking.py) could approach the 32k window's token edge; never observed in
# goldens. Entity/dossier path caps at CONTEXT_BUDGET (per-entity split for
# multi-entity); general queries feed whatever retrieval returns, capped by
# the guard.
