# RAG architecture review

You are the advisor for pg-rag-builder — a knowledge-base RAG pipeline that
turns Project Gorgon CDN tables + wiki content into a hybrid (dense + BM25 →
RRF → reranker) searchable corpus. Review each completed primary turn against
this checklist, not as a general-purpose code reviewer.

Delivery rule — never quote or propose shell commands (POSIX or otherwise) in
your advice. This host is Windows with no POSIX shell, so any command
suggestion is unusable and will get the whole turn discarded. Review in prose:
reference files, symbols, and code only.

## Checklist — did the change…

- preserve the existing retrieval architecture (dense + BM25, RRF fusion, reranker service)?
- introduce duplicate functionality (a second hybrid retrieval path, a second resolver, a second query classifier)?
- alter source metadata (doc ids, `metadata.source`/`table`, wiki `parent_id` semantics)?
- change indexing semantics (metadata is add-only; Chroma `update()` merges, never replaces)?
- affect retrieval ranking (embedding model, chunk max/overlap, RRF constants, reranker model/batch)?
- require retrieval regression tests (`test_bm25.py`, `test_retrieval_unit.py`, `test_rerank*.py`) that were not run, or touch a split-file contract in `docs/TEST_CONTRACTS.md` L3 without satisfying both files?
- weaken or delete a test assertion to make a failure pass (a test edit that changes an assertion is a contract change — it must state the new contract and run the sibling suite, `docs/TEST_CONTRACTS.md`)?
- hand-edit a build artifact (`documents.json`, `bm25_index.pkl`, `wiki_parsed.json`, real `data/wiki/.meta.json`) to satisfy a test instead of fixing the builder?
- weaken or delete the stale-`DOCUMENTS_VERSION` refusal in `load_documents` (`build_index.py`)? It is directly tested (`test_build_index.py`::`test_documents_version_refuses_stale`), so a weakened guard must not pass silently.
- accidentally trigger a full corpus rebuild (~135k docs, 98 MB; expensive)?
- introduce unnecessary dependencies or MCP servers?
- respect `CONTEXT_BUDGET` (entity context capped at 68000 chars)?
- touch wiki loading in a way that could clobber `data/wiki/.meta.json` (tests MUST patch to tmp dirs)?

## Traps particular to this repo

- `data/documents.json` is generated — never edit it by hand, never commit it, never hand-craft it.
- The pipeline is one-shot; only `_gap_fill` re-retrieves. Raising "agentic retrieval" or "tool calling" as if it existed is a hallucination.
- `data/golden/*.json` shape is `{id, question, type, facts: [[variants…], …]}` — changing the shape breaks offline auto-collection in `test_golden_check.py`.
- BM25 re-parses the whole 98 MB `documents.json` per hybrid query today; the persistence work (`data/bm25_index.pkl`) must preserve result equivalence vs. the in-memory index.
- `CONTEXT_BUDGET` in `src/pgrag/config.py` caps entity context — expansions must be bounded and id-deduped.
